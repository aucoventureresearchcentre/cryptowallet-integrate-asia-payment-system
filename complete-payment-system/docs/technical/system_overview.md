## Technical Implementation

### Core Payment Processing

The core payment processing module is implemented in Go, providing high performance, concurrency, and reliability. Key features include:

- **Transaction Creation**: Generates unique payment addresses and transaction IDs
- **Payment Validation**: Verifies transaction details and regulatory compliance
- **Status Tracking**: Monitors blockchain confirmations and updates payment status
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Handles different cryptocurrencies with specific validation rules

### API Communication

The system uses a RESTful API architecture with the following security measures:

- **API Authentication**: Uses API keys and HMAC signatures for request authentication
- **Request Signing**: Implements timestamp and nonce-based request signing
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse through request rate limiting
- **TLS Encryption**: All API communication is encrypted using TLS

### Database Schema

The system uses a relational database with the following key tables:

- **Merchants**: Stores merchant information and API credentials
- **Transactions**: Records all payment transactions and their status
- **Wallets**: Manages cryptocurrency wallets and addresses
- **ExchangeRates**: Stores current and historical exchange rates
- **Compliance**: Records regulatory compliance information

### Security Implementation

Security is implemented at multiple levels:

- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Key Management**: Private keys are stored securely using hardware security modules (HSMs)
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control for administrative functions
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all system activities
- **Fraud Detection**: Machine learning-based fraud detection system

## Integration Patterns

### Web Integration

Web integration follows these steps:

1. Initialize the SDK with merchant credentials and country code
2. Create a payment with amount, currency, and cryptocurrency
3. Display the payment QR code to the customer
4. Monitor payment status and update the UI accordingly

### POS Terminal Integration

POS terminal integration follows these steps:

1. Initialize the SDK with merchant credentials and country code
2. Create a payment with amount, currency, and cryptocurrency
3. Display the payment QR code on the terminal screen
4. Monitor payment status and print receipt upon completion

### Kiosk Integration

Kiosk integration follows these steps:

1. Initialize the SDK with merchant credentials and country code
2. Create a payment with amount, currency, and cryptocurrency
3. Display the payment QR code on the kiosk screen
4. Monitor payment status and dispense goods/services upon completion
