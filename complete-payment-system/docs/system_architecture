## Data Flow Architecture

### Payment Processing Flow:

1. **Initiation**: Customer initiates payment through website, terminal, or kiosk
2. **Validation**: System validates the transaction against country-specific regulations
3. **Rate Calculation**: Current exchange rates are applied
4. **Payment Address Generation**: Unique payment address is generated
5. **Transaction Monitoring**: System monitors for incoming transaction
6. **Confirmation**: Transaction is confirmed on blockchain
7. **Settlement**: Merchant account is credited
8. **Notification**: Both customer and merchant are notified

### Settlement Flow:

1. **Aggregation**: Transactions are aggregated for efficient processing
2. **Conversion**: Optional conversion to fiat or stablecoins
3. **Fee Calculation**: System calculates and deducts fees
4. **Transfer**: Funds are transferred to merchant's preferred wallet/account
5. **Reporting**: Transaction details are recorded for reporting

## Technical Stack

### Backend:
- **Language**: Go (for core processing), Node.js (for APIs)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (transactional data), MongoDB (logs and analytics)
- **Blockchain Interfaces**: Web3.js, Bitcoin Core, etc.
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing
- **Caching**: Redis

### Frontend/SDKs:
- **Web**: JavaScript/TypeScript, React components
- **Mobile**: Kotlin (Android), Swift (iOS)
- **Kiosk**: Electron, .NET (for Windows-based kiosks)

### DevOps:
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitLab CI
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack

## Security Architecture

### Data Protection:
- All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Private keys stored in HSM (Hardware Security Module)
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Authentication and Authorization:
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for authentication
- Role-based access control
- API key management
- IP whitelisting

### Compliance:
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Country-specific data protection laws

## Deployment Architecture

### Deployment Options:
1. **Cloud-based**: Hosted solution with high availability
2. **On-premises**: For merchants with specific security requirements
3. **Hybrid**: Core services in cloud, sensitive operations on-premises

### Regional Deployments:
- Multiple regional deployments to ensure low latency
- Data residency compliance for countries with data localization laws

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling:
- Stateless services for easy replication
- Database sharding for high transaction volumes
- Read replicas for reporting and analytics

### Vertical Scaling:
