# Cryptocurrency Regulations in Laos (2025)

## Overview
Laos has taken tentative steps toward regulating cryptocurrencies, with regulations for cryptoasset mining and trading firms in place since November 2021. The country is operating under a pilot program that began in September 2021, allowing limited cryptocurrency activities under specific conditions.

## Regulatory History
- September 9, 2021: Laos announced a pilot program to allow cryptocurrency mining and trading (Notification No. 1158)
- November 2021: Regulations for cryptoasset mining and trading firms were issued
- January 2022: The central bank of Laos licensed two firms to offer cryptoasset trading as part of the three-year trial

## Regulatory Authority
The Bank of the Lao PDR (BOL) is the primary regulatory authority for cryptocurrencies in Laos.

## Current Regulatory Framework
- The regulatory regime remains in a pilot phase and is considered "ministerial level" rather than final
- Regulations aim to protect the interests of both operators and users
- Six companies were initially authorized to trade and mine cryptoassets in the trial program
- Two firms were subsequently licensed by the central bank to offer cryptoasset trading

## Business Requirements
For cryptocurrency businesses in Laos:
- Must have Lao shareholder(s) holding at least 51% of the total shares
- Must submit a feasibility study with timeframe
- Must pay royalty fees for permission to operate

## Regulatory Gaps (Identified by FATF in 2023)
- Limited understanding of risks posed by virtual assets
- Insufficient measures to mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing risks
- Prohibitions on virtual asset services only extend to trading and do not apply to other activities
- Supervision and monitoring of the virtual asset sector has been limited
- Lack of steps to identify and sanction unlicensed virtual asset service providers

## Recent Developments
- January 3, 2025: Bank of the Lao PDR issued Decision No. 11/BOL on the Use of Foreign Currency in Lao PDR
- November 2023: The Lao government announced it would suspend business operations, impose fines, and potentially revoke licenses of cryptocurrency companies that fail to make progress or fulfill agreements

## Outlook
While Laos has taken initial steps toward regulating cryptocurrencies, the regulatory framework remains in development. The country is taking a cautious approach through its pilot program, with potential for more comprehensive regulations as the trial progresses and as the government addresses gaps identified by international organizations like FATF.
