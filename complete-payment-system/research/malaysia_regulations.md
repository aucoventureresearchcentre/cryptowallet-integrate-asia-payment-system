# Cryptocurrency Regulations in Malaysia (2025)

## Overview
Malaysia has established a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, defining digital assets as securities rather than legal tender. The country continues to develop its legal framework for digital assets and service providers.

## Recent Developments
- Guidelines on Prevention of Money Laundering (2024)
- Amendment of the Capital Markets and Services Act (2025)
- Tax enforcement actions targeting cryptocurrency trading (June 2024)
- Crackdown on unauthorized Bitcoin mining operations (August 2024)
- Potential new cryptocurrency and blockchain legislation announced in January 2025

## Digital Asset Categories
According to Malaysia's Prescription Order 2019 and the amended Capital Markets and Services Order 2025, digital assets are categorized as:

1. **Digital Currency**: Digital representation of value recorded on a distributed digital ledger that functions as a medium of exchange and is interchangeable with money.

2. **Digital Tokens**: Digital representation recorded on a distributed digital ledger, excluding government-issued debentures/bonds, corporate shares/debentures, and units in trust schemes.

## Business Categories
Companies operating in Malaysia's cryptocurrency space fall into one of these categories:

1. **Recognized Market Operator for Digital Asset Exchanges (RMO-DAX)**: Electronic platforms facilitating digital asset trading.

2. **Digital Asset Custodian (DAC)**: Provides custody services for digital assets.

3. **Initial Exchanges Offering (IEO)**: Offers fundraising channels through digital tokens.

## Regulatory Authorities
1. **Securities Commission Malaysia (SCM)**: Primary regulator for digital asset service providers. Registration required for companies dealing with assets qualified as securities.

2. **Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM)**: The central bank monitors cryptocurrency use to ensure financial system integrity.
