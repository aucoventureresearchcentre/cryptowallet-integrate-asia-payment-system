# Cryptocurrency Regulations in Cambodia (2025)

## Overview
Cambodia has recently introduced formal regulations for cryptocurrencies through the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC), marking a significant shift from its previous stance. The new regulatory framework permits commercial banks and payment settlement institutions to provide services relating to cryptoassets under specific conditions.

## Regulatory History
- 2018: NBC, Securities and Exchange Regulator of Cambodia, and General-Commissariat of National Police issued a joint statement prohibiting any activities related to cryptocurrencies without a license
- December 26, 2024: NBC issued Prakas B7-024-735 Prokor on Transactions Related to Cryptoassets ("Prakas on Cryptoassets")
- January 2025: Implementation of the new regulatory framework began

## Regulatory Authority
The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) is the primary regulator for cryptoassets in Cambodia.

## Legal Framework
The Prakas on Cryptoassets formally permits:
- Commercial banks and payment settlement institutions to provide services relating to cryptoassets (subject to prior NBC approval)
- Commercial banks to hold cryptoasset exposure (subject to prior NBC approval)
- Legal entities to provide services relating to cryptoassets (subject to NBC license)

## Classification of Cryptoassets
The regulation classifies cryptoassets into two groups:

1. **Group 1**: Digital representation of traditional financial instruments or assets with value referring to traditional assets
   - **Group 1a**: Tokenized securities
   - **Group 1b**: Stablecoins
   
2. **Group 2**: All cryptoassets that don't meet Group 1 criteria, particularly unbacked cryptoassets

## Operational Restrictions
- Commercial banks may provide services for their own accounts only for Group 1 (not Group 2)
- Group 1a exposures must not exceed 5% of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (CET1 Capital)
- Group 1b exposures must not exceed 3% of CET1 Capital
- Commercial banks must file quarterly reports on cryptoasset exposures

## Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs)
CASPs are defined as legal entities providing services related to cryptoassets:
- Exchange against official currencies or other cryptoassets
- Transfer services
- Custody and administration

## Licensing Requirements
- Commercial banks and payment institutions need prior approval from NBC
- Legal entities must obtain a license from NBC
- Detailed conditions and procedures for approval/licensing will be set out in a separate regulation

## Compliance and Enforcement
- Failure to comply with regulations subjects entities to disciplinary sanctions under Article 52 of the Law on Banking and Financial Institutions
- NBC may impose fines on commercial banks that don't comply with operational restrictions, exposure limits, or reporting requirements

## Future Developments
NBC plans to issue two additional regulations:
1. Conditions and procedures for CASP approval/licensing
2. Regulations on cryptoasset exposures by commercial banks
