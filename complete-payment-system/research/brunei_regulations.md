# Cryptocurrency Regulations in Brunei (2025)

## Overview
Brunei has issued minimal guidance on cryptocurrencies, primarily focusing on warning the public about associated risks. The country has not established a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.

## Regulatory Authority
The Central Bank of Brunei, Autoriti Monetari Brunei Darussalam (AMBD), is the primary financial regulator in the country.

## Legal Status
- Cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in Brunei Darussalam
- Cryptocurrencies are not regulated by AMBD
- No specific prohibition on cryptocurrency trading or ownership
- No comprehensive regulatory framework exists

## Official Statements
On December 22, 2017, AMBD released a statement titled "PUBLIC TO EXERCISE HIGH CAUTION WITH CRYPTOCURRENCIES" that:
1. Reminded the public that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in Brunei
2. Warned that cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous and often traded on platforms of unknown jurisdictions
3. Noted that cryptocurrency is susceptible to being misused for illegal activities
4. Highlighted cybersecurity risks associated with cryptocurrencies
5. Warned about the speculative nature of cryptocurrency values
6. Advised the public to conduct due diligence before participating in any investment plans or financial transactions

## Current Approach
Brunei maintains a cautious approach to cryptocurrencies, neither explicitly legalizing nor banning them. The government has primarily focused on warning citizens about potential risks rather than creating a regulatory framework for the industry.
